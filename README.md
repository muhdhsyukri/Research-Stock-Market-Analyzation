# Research-Stock-Market-Analyzation
This project explores stock market trends and volatility for four major tech companies — Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), NVIDIA (NVDA), and Alphabet (GOOGL) — using R programming and reproducible data analysis workflows.

Over the course, this project includes:

1) Data collection from Yahoo Finance (1-year historical data)
2) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): returns, volume, and price movement
3) Visualization: line charts, histograms, and moving averages
4) Risk and correlation analysis among multiple tickers
5) A clean and reproducible R Markdown report
6) Optional interactive dashboard (Tableau)

This repository serves as both a learning portfolio and a demonstration of practical skills in R, data storytelling, and financial insight generation.
