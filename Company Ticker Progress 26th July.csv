AMED,Analysis-Trump's antitrust enforcers 'get out of the way' of multibillion-dollar deals,"(Reuters) -President Donald Trump's antitrust enforcers recently cleared a string of multibillion-dollar deals in a week, demonstrating a willingness to settle with companies that marks a shift from the Biden administration.  The U.S. Department of Justice's Antitrust Division and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission cleared three deals that were together worth $63 billion in June, illustrating how FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson and DOJ antitrust head Gail Slater are taking a different tack from their predecessors.  The settlements, along with a return to formally cutting short waiting periods, provide certainty to dealmakers and could smooth the path for companies like Nutella maker Ferrero, which on Thursday entered a deal to pay $3.1 billion for cereal maker WK Kellogg.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysis-trumps-antitrust-enforcers-way-181954386.html?.tsrc=rss,"Thu, 10 Jul 2025 18:19:54 +0000",2025-07-10 14:19:54-04:00,16,2025-07-10 14:19:54-04:00,97.64,97.58,97.69,97.71,96.09,0.06,-0.05,-0.07,1.61,0.0,0.75
